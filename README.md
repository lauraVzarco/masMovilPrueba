# masMovil
Technichal test for MasMovil.
In thus test I've create an API Rest with Node JS of mobile phone (In this case i've mocked de API), then, in the App i've showed a list with the name and an image of the phones. When you click in one of the phones, a new page is open whre you can see more things about the phones. 
To run this app you have to clone the repo and start  with 
```bash
npm install
```
To start to run the server

```bash
node src/server/index.js
```
and finally, to preview it

```bash
npm start
```
with this you can run the API and the APP
