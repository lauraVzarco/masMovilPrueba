# masMovil
Technichal test for MasMovil.
In this test I've create an API Rest with Node JS that exposeds mocked data about mobile phones. The App shows a list with the name and an image of the phones. WClicking in one of the phones takes you to a detail view where you can see more info about it.
To run this app you have to clone the repo and start  with:
```bash
npm install
```
To start to run the server

```bash
node src/server/index.js
```
and finally, to preview it

```bash
npm start
```
with this you can run the API and the APP
